\subsection{Mahne, Baglin, Collins et al. 2004 (ELETTRA)}
\label{sec:Mahne}
This paper~\cite{mahne} covers only the photon reflectivity distributions, these were measured at ELETTRA, Italy.
The studied materials were Copper samples with and without sawtooth.

\subsubsection{Experiment setup}
The experiment discussed in this paper is based on measured photons instead of electrons, see Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_mahne}.
Copper samples were irradiated with synchrotron light between 8 and 200~eV.
The reflectivity of the samples were measured in different directions.
The electron yields however could not be recorded.

\subsubsection{Results}

The main results are listed in Fig.~\ref{fig:mahne}.
First, the reflectivity depending on the angle is shown for synchrotron radiation with a critical energy of 44~eV, similar to the previously discussed paper from Baglin et al.
The difference is that not only the reflectivity in forward direction was measured, but in all directions.
Figure~\ref{fig:mahne} (bottom) specifies the total reflectivity.
In case of the sawtooth, reflectivity increases from 1.8\% to 10\%.

Furthermore, it was found that the reflectivity depends on the photon energy.
This means that also the spectrum of reflected photons is different from the original one.


\subsubsection{Open questions}
Some inconsistencies exist.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Baglin paper from Sec.~\ref{sec:Baglin} states the reflectivity as 1.8\% for the sawtooth sample, whereas the forward scattering in this paper alone amounts to 4\%.
    \item Furthermore, it is unclear how the 2\% diffused photons are obtained from a white light spectrum.
        In Fig.~\ref{fig:mahne} (right), the amount of diffused photons never reaches 2\% for any photon energy.
        %Certainly, the 2\% cannot be reached for a spectrum of photons, either.
        This discrepancy is not commented in the paper.
    \item The photon flux is not stated, photon scrubbing is not mentioned.
\end{itemize}
